# Boundary-Line

These are LYR files for Boundary-Line in ESRI Shapefile format for use in ESRI ArcGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data in its Layered supply*

## Quick start guide

**Method 1**

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/Boundary-Line-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference and copy all the ESRI Layer files into the same directory as your Boundary-Line ESRI Shapefile data

**2.**  Open a new blank map in ArcMap

**3.**  In the labelling toolbar, click on 'Use Maplex Label Engine' to turn on Maplex

**4.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to your data folder

**5.**  Select the desired layer files and click ‘Add’. The data should appear pre-styled

*Alternatively see Method 2*

**6.**  Boundary-Line contains different categories of boundary. It is unlikely that they will need to be viewed all together but we recommend the following layer order, please turn layers on and/or off depending on your use of the data.

We recommend viewing the map with the preset scale ranges for maximum legibility. You may need to zoom in or out before the boundaries appear. You can change or remove the scale ranges within the 'Layer Properties' window

Your map should now look similar to this:

**7.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your Boundary-Line data > select the data that matches the layer, for example 'european_region_region.shp' > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 7 for all required layers.
