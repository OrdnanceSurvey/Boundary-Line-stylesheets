# Boundary-Line

These are QML files for Boundary-Line in ESRI Shapefile format for use in QGIS

*They have been designed to work with the data in its Layered supply*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/Boundary-Line-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy all the QML stylesheets (those files ending .qml) into the same directory as your Boundary-Line ESRI Shapefile data

**3.**  Load your Boundary-Line data into QGIS and it should appear pre-styled

*Aternatively you can load each style individually through the 'Layer Properties' window within QGIS*

**4.**  Boundary-Line contains different categories of boundary. It is unlikely that they will need to be viewed all together but we recommend the following layer order, please turn layers on and/or off depending on your use of the data:

**NOTE:** We have set scale ranges to each layer so you may need to zoom in or out before the boundaries appear. You can change or remove the scale ranges within the 'Layer Properties' window

Your data should now look similar to this:
